# Exploring Password Complexity: A Comparative Analysis of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Approaches for Password Strength Classification
## S&DS 492 - Senior Thesis

Within the first four months of 2023 [1], 17 major companies reported data breaches. Although many companies store password encryptions instead of raw passwords, these breaches still pose a threat to account holders. Attackers can access personal information if they are able to crack the password. Companies use algorithms to determine password strength and derive their password policy accordingly. In 2012, Dropbox released their zxcvbn, their own algorithm for classifying passwords [2]. In this project, we examined password complexity as defined by zxcvbn through the use of supervised and unsupervised methods. 700,000 passwords were randomly sampled from the 2015 000webhost data breach. Their strengths were classified by the zxcvbn algorithm, and we extract several features to capture the un- derlying pattern of the data, including n-grams, Shannon entropy, Levenshtein distance, and character repetition weight sum. For the supervised methods, we used a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). For the unsupervised methods, we used K-means clustering at dif- ferent clusterinng levels. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to uncover patterns in password strength and identify the most influential features in predicting password complexity. This analysis offers valuable insights into password complexity and its relationship with the zxcvbn algorithm, contributing to the development of more robust password policies and enhanced user security.
